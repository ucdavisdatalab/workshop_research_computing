# Installing Software with Pixi

_One 2-hour session_

Learn how to install and manage open-source software packages for research
computing. Installing software is often tricky due project-specific
requirements for package versions---which can conflict with other
projects---and inconsistent or incomplete install documentation. We’ll focus
on using [Pixi][], a package manager for [the conda ecosystem][conda-eco], to
create independent, reproducible software environments and install software
with ease. We’ll also briefly discuss the unique advantages of using Pixi for
Python projects and how Pixi compares to other package managers.

:::{admonition} Learning Goals
:class: note
After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:

+ Explain what computing environments are
+ Explain what virtual environments are and why they're useful
+ List popular tools for installing software on POSIX computers
+ Create and organize project directories for projects
+ Initialize projects with Pixi
+ Install software with Pixi

The second half of this workshop is modular, and which units are covered is
up to the instructor. Each unit lists specific learning goals.
