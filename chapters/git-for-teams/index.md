# Git for Teams

_One 2-hour session_

This workshop goes beyond the basics of Git: it explains how to customize Git
to suit your preferred workflow and how to take full advantage of Git and
GitHub's collaborative features. Topics include why and how to use branches,
how to merge branches even when there are conflicts, how to use GitHub's
project management features, and ways to configure Git to be more convenient.
This workshop also prepares learners to use Git to contribute to open-source
projects.
