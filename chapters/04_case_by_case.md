Case-by-case Practices
======================

:::{attention}
This chapter is still a work-in-progress and will be completed sometime in Fall
Quarter 2024. Check back when you've got some experience with research
computing and are ready to learn more.
:::

This chapter covers case-by-case practices for reproducibility. Many of these
practices require substantial effort to adopt or require specific technical
knowledge. They can be important and even essential for certain kinds of
projects, but we feel they aren't broadly applicable in the ways that core and
case-by-case core practices are. DataLab occasionally adopts these practices.
Read this chapter when you feel like you've mastered the practices in the
previous chapters and want to learn even more.
