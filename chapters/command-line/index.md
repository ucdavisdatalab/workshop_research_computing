# Introduction to the Command Line

_One 2-hour session_

Learn and practice how to talk directly to your computer via the command
line. The command line is a powerful tool for using scientific software,
working with large data sets, and controlling remote servers. It is primarily
used to manage files and run programs, and it allows for automation of
repetitive tasks. This workshop is a prerequisite for many of DataLab's other
workshops, including all of the following workshops in this list.
