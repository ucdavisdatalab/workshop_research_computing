Interacting with Our Computers: A Very Brief Primer

Most people interact with their computer through a graphical user interface, or
GUI, which allows them to use a mouse, keyboard, and graphical elements on
screen (such as file menus, pictures of folders and files, etc.) as they do
their work. We tend to conflate our operating systems and their GUIs because
computer hardware and software manufacturers tightly pack these two things
together as a convenience to users. But the operating system that makes your
computer work (Windows 10, Mac Big Sur, etc.) and the GUI that you interact
with are, in fact, completely different and separable software packages. It is
possible to use different methods/software to interact with your computer other
than the stock GUI that launches automatically when you turn it on.

One such method is the **command line interface** (CLI). The command line
offers a text-only means of interacting with your computer, acting somewhat
like a typewriter (rather than a *window* or *desktop*, as the prevailing
metaphors for GUIs go). You can think of this interface as having three main
parts:

1. A **terminal**: an environment (like a window) with which to send/receive
information to/from your computer
2. A **shell**: a program that interprets and executes commands you enter into
the terminal (common programs include Bash and Zsh)
3. The **command line**: where you enter commands that a shell interprets and
executes; a form of interaction that involves typing commands into a terminal

In the early days of computing, all user interaction with your computer
happened at the command line. But during the 1980s, computer
manufacturers---with Apple at the lead---made a big push to convert their
machines to the windowing systems we know today. A CLI, they felt, was too
difficult for users to understand and this, in turn, would hamper computer
sales. Nowadays there are few viable (and at present, almost no commercially
available) programs that can compete with the predominant systems of Macs and
PCs. While this is less the case for Linux machines, people are by and large
locked into the GUIs that come pre-installed on their machines. CLIs are,
however, available, and some are even installed on popular computer hardware.

To the Command Line: A Mentality Shift
--------------------------------------

The following sections will discuss how to open and use CLIs. Doing so is
necessarily action-oriented: the workshop covers a host of different commands
that will help you in your day-to-day work on a computer. But knowing the
pragmatics of using a CLI is only one part of a broader change in the mentality
we bring to interacting with our computers beyond the GUI. When we work on the
command line, we find ourselves doing things computers typically _do for us_.
Because of this, we need to know more about how our computers work than we
would if we only used a GUI.

This workshop only covers a small part of that knowledge, but the commands and
conventions we'll discuss tend to generalize to other activities like writing
code or tracking files with version control. Learning this material, then, is
in part about preparing yourself to learn more advanced computing skills later
on. As such, this workshop -- and with it, our live session -- will cover
broader concepts and conventions in computing as much as it will show you how
to use the command line.
