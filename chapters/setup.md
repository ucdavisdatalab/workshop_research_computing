# Setup

The following instructions are for **Windows users only**. Mac and Linux both
come pre-installed with Unix-ready command line interfaces, whereas Windows
does not. Interested to know why? [This article][] offers a nice overview of
the history of different operating systems.

## Git Bash

Windows users may install any one of a number of applications that emulate the
Unix command line and provide direct access to your normal files. We recommend
Git Bash, which is included when you install Git, a version control system. Git
Bash smoothly integrates with your machine's file system, and installing it
alongside Git will prepare you for later data-driven work (not to mention the
DataLab's [Introduction to Version Control][] and [Reproducible Research for
Teams with GitHub][] workshops!).

## Installing Git and Git Bash

The DataLab has a short, 10-minute tutorial on installing Git and Git Bash. It
walks through some brief configuration options and then shows you how to verify
that your installation has worked. You can find this tutorial at the [DataLab
Install Guides page][]. Under "1. Command Line Tools," you'll want to look for
section 1.1: "Git."

If you are not able to successfully install Git/Git Bash on your own machine,
please attend DataLab’s Virtual Office Hours. Click [here][] for more
