# Research Computing Starter Pack

This collection of workshops provides an introduction to the concepts,
workflows, and tools fundamental to reproducible computational research. The
workshops are:

* Reproducibility Principles and Practices (one 1-hour session)
* Introduction to the Command Line (one 2-hour session)
* Installing Software with Pixi (one 2-hour session)
* Introduction to Version Control (one 2-hour session)
* Git for Teams (one 2-hour session)

No prior programming experience is required for this workshop series, assuming
you complete the series in order.

Open-source tools are an integral part of many research projects. Contributing
to these projects ensures they continue to be sustainable, and releasing
research-related code under open-source licenses ensures computational research
is reproducible. These workshops are part of the [University of California Open
Source Program Office Network][ucospo] and their development was funded in part
by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
