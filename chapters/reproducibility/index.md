# Reproducibility Principles and Practices

_One 1-hour session_

A research project is **reproducible** if a different researcher can carry
out the same analysis with the same data and produce the same overall result.
To do so, they need transparent, detailed documentation about _all_ of the
steps in the research process and access to the tools---especially
code---with which the steps were carried out. Reproducibility enables
independent verification, a touchstone for all research.

There are myriad practices, often accompanied by software tools, that can
help ensure research projects are reproducible. This overview workshop will
help you decipher which to adopt and when to adopt them. The workshop also
highlights additional benefits many of these practices confer, such as making
it easier to collaborate with others. As an overview, this workshop is
relatively non-technical, but provides technical references, including other
DataLab workshops, for all of the practices covered.

This workshop is intended for learners at all experience levels, and may
benefit learners at different experience levels in different ways.

:::{admonition} Learning Goals
:class: note
After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:

+ Describe widely-used practices and tools for ensuring that research projects
are reproducible, such as:
   - Writing documentation
   - File and directory naming conventions
   - Version control systems
   - Software environment management
   - Build systems
   - Packaging
   - Software testing
   - Virtualization and containerization
+ Explain the advantages and disadvantages of these reproducibility practices
+ Evaluate whether a given reproducibility practice is relevant to their
research project
+ Identify references they can consult to learn technical details about
reproducibility practices
+ Explain the ways in which reproducibility practices can facilitate
collaboration for active research projects
