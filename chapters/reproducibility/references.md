Many other people have written excellent guides, articles, and blogs about
doing reproducible research computing. Here are a few of the ones we think
might be helpful:

* [The Turing Way][turing] is an open-source, collaborative, and
  community-driven online handbook about reproducible, ethical, and
  collaborative data science.

* [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing][good-enuff] is an
  open-source journal article about the equivalent of "basic lab skills" for
  research computing.

* [Fourteen things you need to know about collaborating with data
  scientists][fourteen] is a column that addresses many issues related to
  reproducibility, written by several members of DataLab.

* [Living in an Ivory Basement][idyll] is [C. Titus Brown][titus]'s blog, which often
  touches on best practices for reproducible and collaborative research.
