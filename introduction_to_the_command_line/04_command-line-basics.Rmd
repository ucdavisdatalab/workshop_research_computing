Command Line Basics
===================

To use the command line, we need to launch a special program. **Mac users** will 
use a terminal application called -- fittingly -- "Terminal." It ships by default 
on macOS.

To launch Terminal, go to:

> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

When you launch the application, you will see something like this:

![Mac Terminal window](img/prompt.png)

**Windows** users will use the Git Bash terminal. Instructions for installing 
this program are in the second section of this workshop reader.

To launch Git Bash, go to:

> Click on the Windows Start Menu and search for "Git Bash"

Alternatively,

> Click on the Windows Start Menu, select Programs, and browse to Git Bash

When you launch the application, you will see something like this:

The Anatomy of the Command Line
-------------------------------

While the command line can look intimidating to those raised on a GUI, it's 
important to know that both of the programs above are *interfaces* in the same 
way that your computer's default windowing system is an interface. That is, even 
though a CLI is something of a bare bones representation of your computer, it 
too relies on a series of assumptions and metaphors that serve to frame how 
you interact with your computer. Using the CLI may feel strange at first, but 
part of that feeling comes from not being acclimated to the way it *represents* 
a computer.

For example, instead of pointing and clicking on things in your computer, as you'd 
do with a GUI, you type in your commands with a CLI. In this way, a CLI is more 
like a typewriter than it is a desktop (an even better analogue would be a 
[teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter)).

To see this, let's return to the window that opens when you start Terminal or Ubuntu.

![Mac Terminal window](img/prompt.png)

Everything that will happen in this window happens on a line-by-line basis. Here, 
we see the command line **prompt**, where you'll type your commands. The prompt 
itself offers valuable information about your computer. The beginning of the line, 
`tshoe@ds`, tells us the current user (`tshoe`) and current computer (`ds`). 
This may seem redundant, but with the command line it is possible to interact 
with remote computers via a network, so it can be helpful to have this 
information displayed as a reference point.

The bit of information after the colon (in this example, the `~` character) tells 
us where in the computer's filesystem we are. We'll discuss this later. For now, 
just keep in mind that you can look here to find your current location. In this 
case, `~` means you are in your **home** directory.

![Mac Terminal with the Home symbol highlighted](img/prompt_home_highlight.png)

After the location, we see the `$` character. It is an indicator that lets you 
know the command line application is waiting for you to enter something. (Note 
that you do not need to type this character, it will appear automatically, but 
the examples below include it to emulate what you'll see onscreen)

Depending on your system and/or command line interface, you may or may not also 
see a solid or flashing box that appears after the prompt character. This is a 
**cursor position indicator** and it tells you where the current cursor is in 
the terminal. This is useful if you need to go back and correct and error. 
Since you can't click around with a mouse in a CLI, you'll have to use your 
computer's `Left` and `Right` arrows to move the cursor to your desired location 
and make any changes from there.

Interacting with the Command Line
---------------------------------

Now we can enter some commands, which is simply a matter of typing them in after 
the prompt. For example:

```
$ echo
```


...will print back to screen any text that you supply to the command. It literally 
echoes your text:

```
$ echo "Hello world!"
Hello world!
```

To execute this, or any command, you simply hit the `Return`/`Enter` key on your 
keyboard. You'll see that when you execute a command, your computer's shell 
program will interpret and execute the indicated operation, print any output from 
that operation to screen, and deliver a new command line prompt.

If you want to see what files and folders are in your home directory, you can
use `ls` ("list"):

```
$ ls
backups  data.csv  jupyter_notebook.ipynb  project_folder
```

You can also use `ls` on a subfolder to show its contents:

```
$ ls project_folder
file_1.txt  file_2.txt
```

Want some more information about your files and folders? You can modify the base 
functionality of the `ls` command -- and in fact you can do this for many such 
commands -- with **flags**. We do this by adding a dash (`-`) and then a letter, 
or a combination of letters, directly after the dash.

```
ls -lha
```

...will print out information about the permissions, size, and date of the current 
directory's contents, as well as the user(s) who created them:

```
$ ls -lha
.
..
.config_file
drwxrwxr-x 2 tshoe staff 4.0K Jun 21 23:30 backups
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tshoe staff  28K Oct  4 20:42 data.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tshoe staff 6.2K Aug 27 22:44 jupyter_notebook.ipynb
drwxrwxr-x 8 root  root  4.0K Oct  4 21:44 project_folder
```

It's worth walking through this output, because it demonstrates how we can bring 
important information into view with just a few keystrokes. For beginners, the 
most relevant portions of `ls -lha` are likely to be toward the end of the output, 
where the file sizes are listed along with the date each file was last modified. 
To the left of this information are listings for the file owner/file group 
(respectively, `tshoe`/`staff` and `root`/`root`). These listings help us make 
some sense of the most confusing part of the above output: those strings of `r`'s, 
`w`'s, and `x`'s. These represent the various **permissions** for each file. 
Permissions are specific file attributes that control which users can read (`r`), 
change (`w`), or execute (`x`) a file. Depending on what level of permissions 
you, or the user group to which you belong, have been assigned, you may or may 
not be able to work with certain files (if you're on your personal computer, 
you likely have full permissions).

Besides outputting file information, `ls -lha` also shows us three things in 
our folder that were otherwise hidden with just `ls`: `.`, `..`, and 
`.config_file`. The first two are special notation for navigating your 
computer, which we'll discuss in a later section. The last, `.config_file`, is 
a **dotfile**. Dotfiles (named for the `.` that prefaces them) are hidden by 
default on your computer. They often contain various configuration settings 
that people use to customize their computers. Some will also log the history of 
commands you've sent via a CLI (for example, `.bash_history` or `.python_history`). 
We can't discuss these files in depth, but for the moment it's worth 
recognizing that they exist and that you'll occasionally encounter them when 
working on the command lie.

Depending on your particular system and/or CLI, all of the above might look 
slightly different on your computer. However, the basic presentation and 
functionality as described above will be the same. Typing is the predominant 
way of using a CLI, and the results of sending in commands with a CLI are 
text-only representations of your computer and your files.

Command Syntax
--------------

As you can see, the **syntax** of commands is straightforward. Commands use a 
space to delimit their different components, and flags are called with `-` to 
modify those commands. When put together, we can generalize these components 
look like so:

```
$ [command] [optional flags] [file, data, or other pointer on which to run the command]
```

There is one caveat to this: because commands use spaces to delimit their 
components, you can run into problems when running commands on files with spaces 
in their names. Your command line interface program will interpret that file's 
spaces as separate components and an error will almost surely result. If you're 
running a command on a file with a space in its name, you'll need to **escape** 
that space with `\`.

This will throw an error:

```
$ [command] file name.txt
```

This will not:

```
$ [command] file\ name.txt
```

While escape characters are perfectly workable, they can be a bit of a pain to 
type over and over. For this reason, people who use the command line in their 
daily work often avoid spaces altogether when naming their files. If you're 
interested to learn more about what conventions you might use in place of spaces, 
see this [section on file names][] in the DataLab's workshop reader about project 
organization and documentation.

Common Command Line Commands (and More!)
----------------------------------------

During our hands-on workshop session we will practice using several commands, 
which are listed below (along with a few other supplementary ones).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
command <- c(
  "ls",
  "ls -l",
  "ls -h",
  "ls -a",
  "file",
  "cat",
  "pwd",
  "mkdir",
  "cd",
  "mv",
  "cp",
  "unzip",
  "rm",
  "man")
command_fullname <- c(
  "List",
  "List with Long flag",
  "List with Human-Readable flag",
  "List with All flag",
  "File",
  "Concatenate",
  "Print Working Directory",
  "Make Directory",
  "Change Directory",
  "Move",
  "Copy",
  "Unzip",
  "Remove/Delete",
  "Manual")
explanation <- c(
  "Lists all files in the current directory.", 
  "Lists additional information about each file.",
  "Lists file information in a human-readable format.",
  "Lists all files, including hidden files.",
  "Determines the type of file.",
  "Prints the contents of a file to screen.",
  "Prints the current working directory.",
  "Creates a new file directory.",
  "Navigates to another directory on the file system.",
  "Moves files.",
  "Copies files.",
  "Decompresses file archives.",
  "Deletes files.",
  "Opens the manual page for another command.")

command_table <- data.frame(
  `Command`=command, 
  `Command Name`=command_fullname,
  `Function`=explanation,
  check.names=F)
knitr::kable(command_table[,], caption = "")
```

A more complete list of Unix Commands may be found on Valerie Henderson Summet's 
[Unix Cheat Sheet][]. That said, there are dozens of base commands, each with 
their own set of flags, and it's possible to install software that will expand 
that number even more. We can't go over everything in the workshop, but 
familiarizing yourself with the basic command syntax will help you find your way 
around new commands.

One other thing that will help you learn about new commands is `man` ("manual"). 
This opens the manual page for another command:

```
$ man ls
```

...opens:

```
LS(1)                                               User Commands                                               LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of
       -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file  status  information);  with  -l:
              show ctime and sort by name; otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below

       -d, --directory
              list directories themselves, not their contents
[...]
```

As opposed to the usually mute, minimalist disposition of a CLI, here you can see 
thorough documentation for a given command and its various flags. A visually 
condensed version of this information is also accessible by flagging a command 
with `--help`, as in `ls --help`. Sometimes it can also be helpful to know what 
version of a command you're using, as commands themselves can be updated. You 
can find this information for some commands with `--version`, or `--v`:

```
$ man --v
man, version 1.6g
```

Still unclear about what a command does? Look it up with your favorite search 
engine, or visit Stack Exchange and search there. CLIs are widely used software, 
and chances are incredibly good that someone else has had the same question you 
want to ask.

When Problems Arise
-------------------

Error messages offer another, admittedly less pleasant way to learn about how a 
command works. When you're first starting out with any kind of console-based 
software (whether it be a CLI or writing code), one of the most important skills 
you can learn is how to read an error message. For the most part, such messages 
are quite clear; they're intended to help you debug your problem and thus attempt 
to supply you with information about what might be going wrong.

As an example, if you're at your home directory, and it looks like the following:

```
$ ls
backups  data.csv  jupyter_notebook.ipynb  project_folder
```

...and you decide to `ls` a folder within this directory that doesn't exist:

```
$ ls no_name
```

You'll see this error message:

```
$ ls no_name
ls: cannot access 'no_name': No such file or directory
```

This tells you that, while you've sent in a valid `ls` command, it can't find 
what you're looking for.

Likewise, forgetting a space:

```
$ echo"hello"
```

...will produce:

```
$ echo"hello"
zsh: command not found: echohello
```

Or in other words, you've sent in a command that's either invalid or is 
unavailable. These messages are both fairly clear, but if you're ever confused, 
or if you simply want to find out more about an error, a search engine is once 
again your friend. Sometimes simply copy/pasting the error message and searching 
on that alone will lead directly to information about what went wrong.

That all said, sometimes you need to stop a CLI process immediately. Did you, for 
example, do something that causes your computer to print a million lines on 
screen? Did you decide you don't want a file copied to a new location, and it's 
still in the midst of transferring? You can **interrupt** any command with 
`CTRL+C`. This will stop whatever current process is running in your interface.

While you can stop a command, for the most part *it isn't possible to undo a 
command*. Please take care to know exactly what you're running and what you're 
running it on, especially when it comes to modifying or deleting things on your 
computer.
