Editing Files
=============

Beyond the basic commands and navigation functions we've discussed so far, the 
command line also features the ability to edit files directly, usually by means 
of a text editor. These editors are similar in nature to Microsoft Word or Mac 
Pages but they're much more stripped down and tend to work best with **plain text** 
files. These editors are only accessible from the command line and it is 
important to know how to use them so that you can open, read, and write directly 
on the command line.

Plain Text vs. Binary Files
---------------------------

Before continuing on to these editors, we'll briefly distinguish plain text from 
**binary** data. This distinction bears directly on what we can and cannot edit 
using a text editor. In computing, plain text has multiple fuzzy, interlocking 
meanings, but generally it refers to some kind of data that is stored in a 
*human readable* form, which is to say, it is comprised of a collection of text 
characters (usually ASCII, but increasingly UTF-8). A common way to store this 
data is with a `.txt` file, though code files (`.py`, `.R`) and tabular data 
(`.csv`) also fall under the heading of plain text.

Binary data, on the other hand, is not human-readable. It is not stored in a way 
that cleanly translates to various alphanumeric characters; rather, it stores 
data as sequences of 0/1 bits without reference to characters. Often such 
representations are used for data storage. Common file types for binary data 
include ones for images (`.jpg`, `.png`), for sound (`.mp3`), and for various 
executables (`.exe`).

We should note however that, at base, this distinction is somewhat false, in that 
all files are ultimately just binary data. The plain text/binary distinction is 
thus more a matter of how computers *represent* data: bits in plain text represent 
characters, while bits in binary files represent some kind of custom data format, 
which often requires special encoding/decoding protocols to use it.

We can see how all this works if we try to open a binary file with an application 
that doesn't expect this kind of format. For example, if you open this image:

![Image of the Mac Terminal](img/prompt.png)

...with a text editor, you'll see something like this:

```
<89>PNG^M

[...]
```

A complete mess! We're seeing this because text editors aren't able to interpret 
data streams from binary files. They'll do their best to try and parse the stream, 
but that process won't ultimately work. There is thus no way to edit this kind 
of file in a text editor -- you'd simply have no idea where to start. And more, 
making any such changes would likely cause problems with the file data itself, 
since it contains custom encodings that don't correspond to plain text 
characters. If we deleted a snippet of "text" from the output above, resaved it, 
and reopened it in an image viewer...

...we'll see that it's been corrupted.

Inspecting Files
----------------

If, while working on the command line, you need to get a sense of what kind of 
data is stored in a file, the `file` function is useful. Here's an image:

```
$ file broken_image.png
broken_image.png: PNG image data, 520 x 470, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

Based on this information, we can see that that won't work for us. On the other 
hand, this information:

```
$ file README.md
01_overview.Rmd: ASCII text
```

...shows us that `README.md` will. The `ASCII text` message lets us know we can 
open it with a text editor. The same goes for a `.csv`:

```
$ file data.csv
data.csv: CSV text
```

We would be able to open this as well.

Finally, `file` can also tell us whether a file is in an archive format (like 
`.zip`):

```
$ file archived_file.csv.zip
archived_file.csv.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
```

Before opening this, we'd need to use the `unzip` command:

```
$ unzip archived_file.csv.zip
  inflating: archived_file.csv.zip
$ ls
archived_file.csv  archived_file.csv.zip
$ file archived_file.csv
archived_file.csv: CSV text
```

There are two other commands that are useful for inspecting files on the 
command line. `cat` ("concatenate") will print (or attempt to print) in plain text 
the entirety of a file's contents on screen:

```
$ cat file.txt
I'm written in plain text!
```

```
$ cat prompt.png
?PNG

IHDR?.???
         liCCPICC ProfileH??WXS??[RIh?P????U-??T?FH	%Ƅ?bg]Tp?"?]Qt-?,*b/?b???u??(*oB??+?;?7w?{??ʝ??Z?<?4? _R K?
[...]
```

On the other hand, `head` will print the first `N` lines on screen (its default 
is 10 lines):

```
$ head moby_dick.txt
CHAPTER 1. Loomings.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
```

Both commands offer you a method to get an easy glimpse at the contents of files 
on your computer.

**Note:** common word processing software like Microsoft Word poses an interesting 
complication to all of the above. Word docs are actually comprised of a number of 
different, associated files under the hood. It's technically possible to alter 
the text of such files, but finding the location where you'd like to make your 
change can be a big pain, so it's often just easier to use an application that 
has been made to interact with them. Welcome to the world of proprietary software!

Accessing Command Line Text Editors
-----------------------------------

Now that we know what we can and can't edit on the command line, we can make a 
file. To do so, we'll use a text editor called **Vim**. Macs and Git Bash both 
ship with this application, so there's no need to download it (other command line 
editors include Emacs and Nano). If you'd like to open a file with vim, type `vi` 
in a command line window, followed by the filename. You can also create a new 
file this way, simply by typing the name you'd like to use for that file 
after `vi`.

![Creating a new text file with Vim on the command line](img/new_vim_file.png)

Vim works a bit differently than other text editors and word processors. It has 
a number of 'modes,' which provide different forms of interaction with a file's 
data. We will focus on two modes, **Normal** mode and **Insert**. When you open 
a file with Vim, the program starts in Normal mode. This mode is command-based 
and, somewhat strangely, it doesn't let you insert text directly in the document 
(the reasons for this have to do with Vim's underlying design philosophy: we're 
more likely to edit text on the command line than we are to write it).

To insert text in your document, switch to Insert mode by pressing `i`. You can 
check whether you're in Insert mode by looking at the bottom left hand portion 
of the window. You should see an `-- INSERT --` string.

![Vim text editor with Hello World! written in it](img/hello_world_vim.png)

Once you are done inserting text, pressing `ESC` (the Escape key) will bring you 
back to Normal mode. From here, you can save and quit your file, though these 
actions differ from other text editors and word processors: saving and quitting 
with Vim works through a sequence of key commands (or chords), which you enter 
from Normal mode.

To save a file in Vim, make sure you are in Normal mode and then enter `:w`. Note 
the colon, which must be included. After you've entered this key sequence, in the 
bottom left hand corner of your window you should see "[file name] XL, XC written" 
(*L* stands for "lines" and *C* stands for "characters").

![Saving text with Vim](img/saving_vim.png)

To quit Vim, enter `:q`. This should take you back to your command line and, if 
you have created a new file, you will now see that file in your window.

If you don't want to save the changes you've made in a file, you can toss them 
out by typing `:q!` in place of `:w` and then `:q`. Also, in Vim key sequences 
for save, quit, and hundreds of other commands can be chained together. For 
example, instead of separately inputting `:w` and `:q` to save and quit a file, 
you can use `:wq`, which will produce the same effect. There are dozens of base 
commands like this in Vim, and the program can be customized far beyond what 
you'll typically need for basic command line usage. More information about this 
text editor can be found [here](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki).

Basic Vim Commands
------------------

As before with the CLI commands, we'll only cover a small portion of Vim commands 
in the workshop. The table below summarizes them, but a more complete list may be 
found on this [cheat sheet][].

[cheat sheet]: https://vim.rtorr.com/

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vim_command <- c("ESC", "i", ":w", ":q", ":q!")
vim_explanation <- c(
  "Enter Normal mode.", 
  "Enter Insert mdoe.",
  "Save.",
  "Quit.",
  "Quit without saving.")

vim_command_table <- data.frame(
  `Command`=vim_command,
  `Function`=vim_explanation)
knitr::kable(vim_command_table[,], caption = "")
```

Cleaning Up
-----------

Assuming we did save our text file, let's clean up our directory another way. 
The last command we'll discuss is `rm` ("remove"). You can use it to delete files 
and from your computer:

```
$ ls
data.csv  hello.txt  moby_dick.txt  project_folder
$ rm hello.txt
$ ls
data.csv  moby_dick.txt  project_folder
```

Using the `-r` flag (which stands for "recursive"), you can also delete folders:

```
$ rm -r project_folder
$ ls
data.csv  moby_dick.txt
```

Please note that this command, like many such commands on the command line, has 
no undo. It's also a particularly mute command, giving little in the way of an 
indication about what it's doing. If you have multiple files to delete, or if 
you're worried that it might delete something you don't want to remove, you may 
consider putting `rm` in interactive mode with `-i`. This will prompt you with a 
yes/no query for every file the command would remove, given the information you 
supplied it with:

```
$ ls 
data.csv  moby_dick.txt
$ rm -i moby_dick.txt
remove moby_dick.txt? <- enter "no" and press Return/Enter
$ ls
data.csv  moby_dick.txt
```
