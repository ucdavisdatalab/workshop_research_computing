# The Git Workflow

![](/images/version-control/git_workflow.svg)

A typical Git workflow---as illustrated in the figure above---is:

1. Pull recent changes from the remote with `git pull`.
2. Make some changes locally.
3. Stage your changes with `git add`.
4. Commit your changes with `git commit`.
5. Push the changes to the remote with `git push`.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until the project is finished.

There are lots of steps in this process, so there are lots of places where it
can go wrong. _Pay attention to error messages_ and search online if you get
stuck. Lots of people use Git, so your question has probably been asked and
answered. ðŸ˜ƒ

keep at hand as you begin to work with Git.
