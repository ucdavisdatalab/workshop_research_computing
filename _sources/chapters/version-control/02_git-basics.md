(sec-configuring-git)=
## Configuring Git

<!-- TODO: better intro? -->

When you save changes to a repository, Git will automatically sign the changes
with your name and email. In collaborative projects, these signatures are
important for determining who made which changes. Thus the first time you use
Git, you need to set your name and email.

We recommend that you configure Git with your real name (given name and
surname) and a valid email address. These serve the same purpose in Git as they
would on a publication: they ensure you receive credit for your work and give
people a way to contact you about it. Git is open-source, community-developed
software, so it won't share your name and email address with spammers, but the
information *will* be visible on any changes you make to public repositories.

:::{note}
If you're not comfortable attaching your real name to work you do with Git, a
reasonable alternative is to use an alias you control, such as your GitHub
username. {numref}`sec-github` explains more about GitHub.

Likewise, if you don't want to attach your primary email address to work you do
with Git, set up a new email address and use that. Don't make up a fake email
address---someone else could take credit for your work or even impersonate you.
:::

To set your name in Git, open a terminal and type:

```none
git config set --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
```

Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name, keeping the quotes. Then press `Enter`. If
you make a mistake, don't worry: you can run this command to change your name
as many times as you need.

Let's break down what the command means. All Git commands begin with `git`
followed by the name of a subcommand. The command to set Git's configuration
options is `git config set`. The `--global` argument makes the command set
options globally (that is, for all of your repositories). Git stores your name
under the `user.name` configuration option. The final argument is the new value
for `user.name`. So the command sets `user.name` for all repositories to the
    name you put inside the quotes.

The related command `git config get` gets the value of an option. You can use
this to check how Git is configured. For instance, to check what Git thinks
your name is:

```none
git config get user.name
```

:::{tip}
You can view the documentation for any subcommand by adding `--help` to the
end. For instance, to get help with the `git config` subcommand, run `git
config --help`.
:::

Git stores your email address under the `user.email` configuration option. So
to set your email, type:

```none
git config set --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```

Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with your preferred public email address.

Finally, we suggest that you change the default branch name from `master` to
`main`. You'll learn more about what branches are later, but we advise making
this change now. For too long the computing industry has relied on offensive
terms like "master" and "slave" to describe technology, and changing such terms
is part of a [wider push][sfconservancy] to move away from the framework they
imply. This is a small change, but we at the DataLab believe that, in all
instances, language matters.

[sfconservancy]: https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/

To change the default branch name to `main`, run:

```none
git config set --global init.defaultBranch main
```

:::{seealso}
This section is based on the section [First-Time Git Setup][pg-first] of the
book _Pro Git_.

:::


(sec-creating-a-repository)=
## Creating a Repository

Now that we've established what version control systems are, and you've
configured Git, it's time to create a repository.

Open a terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```none
cd
```

To **initialize** a repository called `my_first_repository`, enter:

```none
git init my_first_repository
```

Git will reply with a message like:

```none
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/USERNAME/my_first_repository/.git/
```

When you run the `git init` command, Git first checks whether the specified
directory (`my_first_repository/`) exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Then
Git makes the directory a repository by creating a hidden `.git/` subdirectory.
This subdirectory is where Git will store the history of the repository.

:::{caution}
The `.git/` subdirectory is hidden for a reason. Let Git manage its contents.
Avoid creating or modifying files and directories inside `.git/`, as this might
break your repository. If you delete `.git/`, your repository will no longer be
a repository---it will just be an ordinary directory.
:::

Now let's check that Git actually recognizes `my_first_repository/` as a
repository. First, navigate to the directory:

```none
cd my_first_repository/
```

You can use `git status` to check the status of a repository. Try running it
for the new repository:

```none
git status
```

Since the directory is a repository, Git will respond with output like:

```none
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

We'll save branches for a different lesson. Skipping to the second part of the
message, Git says that there are no "commits" yet. A **commit** is a saved
snapshot (or version) of the repository. You'll learn how to make a commit
soon, but right now, it makes sense that there are no commits yet, since you
just created the repository. Finally, in the third part of the message, Git
says that there is nothing to commit. This also makes sense, since we haven't
created any files in the repository yet.

:::{note}
When Git doesn't recognize a directory as a repository, the output from `git
status` (and most other `git` subcommands) instead looks like:

```none
fatal: not a git repository
```

If you see this message, your working directory is not a Git repository. Most
likely you meant to run the command in a different directory.
:::


(sec-adding-committing-changes)=
## Adding & Committing Changes

Once you've created a repository, you'll want to copy some files into it, or
create new files, so that you can use Git to track their versions.

In `my_first_repository/`, let's create a file with a short self-introduction.
Start by opening a text editor.

:::{admonition} Choosing a Text Editor
:class: note, dropdown
Even if you primarily use software with graphical user interfaces, it's good to
be familiar with a command-line text editor. You can use the editor for quick
edits while at the command-line and on computers that don't provide a graphical
environment (as is often the case for cloud and high-performance computing
resources).

The [GNU nano][nano] text editor is a simple and easy-to-learn. It's typically
pre-installed on Linux and bundled with Git Bash on Windows. On macOS, Pico,
nano's almost-identical predecessor, is pre-installed. You can run nano with
the `nano` command (or run Pico with the `pico` command).

[nano]: https://nano-editor.org/

If you like the simplicity of nano but want features like modern keyboard
shortcuts and syntax highlighting by default, install the [micro][] editor.
It's available for all major operating systems; see the website for details.

[micro]: https://micro-editor.github.io/

[Vim][] is a powerful, customizable text editor, but takes some time to learn.
Vim (or its predecessor vi) is typically pre-installed on macOS and Linux, and
is bundled with Git Bash on Windows. You can run Vim with the `vim` command (or
run vi with the `vi` command).

[Vim]: https://www.vim.org/

Popular alternatives to Vim with similar features include [GNU Emacs][Emacs]
and [Neovim][].

:::


In the text editor, enter a friendly greeting, like this one:

```none
Hi, I'm Nick, and this is my repository!
```

Your greeting doesn't need to be identical, and you can change the name to your
name. Save this as `hello.txt` in the `my_first_repository/` directory. Then
check the status of the repository again:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git notices the new file, `hello.txt`, and says it's **untracked**, which means
Git doesn't have any history for it. You just created the file and haven't
committed it yet, so it makes sense that there's no history.

Let's commit `hello.txt` now. The first step is to add the file to Git's
**staging area** (or **index**). The staging area is a virtual space for
preparing commits, where you can select which changes to include in the commit.
It might help to imagine the staging area as a box ðŸ“¦ that you're packing up to
store or to send to a friend.

The `git add` command adds changes to the staging area. Go ahead and add the
changes to `hello.txt`:

```none
git add hello.txt
```

Now check the status of the repository again:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt
```

Git reports that the changes to `hello.txt` are in the staging area and ready
to be committed. It also lists the command to remove the changes from the
staging area.

:::{tip}
Take advantage of the staging area to curate the contents of your commits.
Putting distinct work in distinct commits makes it easier to inspect (and
occasionally undo) the work.
:::

:::{admonition} Tip: Unstaging Changes
:class: tip, dropdown
In a new repository without any commits, the command to unstage changes is `git
rm --cached`.

In a repository that has commits, the command to unstage changes is `git
restore --staged`. This is the command to remember, since most repositories
have commits.

The distinction can trip up even experienced Git users. If you want a single
unstage command you can use under any circumstances, run:

```none
git config set --global alias.unstage "reset --"
```

Then you can use `git unstage` whenever you want to unstage changes.

<!-- FIXME: uncomment this when the section is added
You can
learn more about what the `git config` command above does in
{numref}`sec-aliases`.
-->
:::

You can make a commit with the `git commit` command. Enter the command:

```none
git commit
```

In response, Git will open a text editor (Vim by default) with the following
text:

```none

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Git will then wait for you to write a **commit message**, a description of what
the commit changes, at the beginning of the text. The first line of the commit
message must be a summary of the commit in 72 characters or less. You can
optionally follow this with a blank second line and then a detailed description
of the commit beginning on the third line.

:::{important}
Strive for clear and meaningful commit messages. If you feel like the changes
in a commit are too numerous or complicated to summarize in one line, use the
optional detailed description.

Commit messages are the history of your project. Neglecting them might save
time in the short run, but in the long run it will make understanding the
project's evolution much more difficult and time-consuming for future you and
your collaborators.
:::

:::{admonition} Tip: The 50/72 Rule
:class: tip, dropdown
Many programmers follow [the 50/72 rule][50-72], which says that the first line
of a commit message should be 50 characters or less and written in the
imperative mood. For example:

```none
Fix typos in the main text.
```

Subsequent lines should be 72 characters or less. The rule makes commit
messages easier to read and understand, especially in the terminal and on
narrow screens.

We recommend following the 50/72 rule, but there are situations where doing
something else is justified. The best approach is to talk to your collaborators
about specific conventions they want to follow, and check in with them about
exceptions to the conventions.

[50-72]: https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
:::

Edit the commit message to look like this:

```none
Add a friendly greeting.
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Finally, to let Git know that you're done, save the commit message and exit the
text editor.

:::{note}
If you exit the text editor without saving, Git will cancel the commit. This is
helpful if you change your mind about making a commit or forget to add
something to the staging area.
:::

<!--
:::{admonition} Using Vim
:class: note, dropdown
In Vim, press `i` to enter insert mode and type the commit message.

When you're finished, press `Esc` to return to normal mode, type `:wq` (the
command to write and quit), and press `Enter`.

If you want to cancel the commit instead, press `Esc` to return to normal mode,
type `:q!` (the command to quit without saving), and press `Enter`.
:::
-->

Git will print some output to confirm that the commit was created:

```none
[main (root-commit) 0f5c79d] Add a friendly greeting.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

Important details in the output include:

* A **hash** that uniquely identifies the commit (`0f5c79d` above, but yours
  will be different)
* The commit message
* The number of files changed
* A list of which files were changed (`hello.txt` in this case)

Run `git status` to see how the output has changed now that you've made a
commit:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Git reports that there's nothing to commit, and that the "working tree" is
clean. The **working tree** consists of the files and directories you actually
have in your repository. The working tree is **clean** if it's identical to the
most recent commit, meaning you haven't changed anything since that commit.

:::{important}
Remember, saving your work in Git is a two step process:

1. `git add` (for each file or directory with changes you want to save)
2. `git commit`

It's a good idea, but not required, to run `git status` after the first step,
to check that you've added all of the changes you meant to add to the staging
area.
:::


### Moving a File

To get more practice making commits, suppose we want to move the file
`hello.txt` to `README.md`, since `README.md` is conventionally the first file
people read when they start working with an unfamiliar repository. Use the `mv`
shell command to move the file:

```none
mv hello.txt README.md
```

Now check the status of the repository:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    hello.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Git notices that `hello.txt` is gone, and also that there's a new file
`README.md`. Since `README.md` is untracked, Git doesn't recognize that it's
the same file as the old `hello.txt`. Go ahead and add the changes to
`README.md` to the staging area:

```none
git add README.md
```

Add the changes to `hello.txt` as well:

```none
git add hello.txt
```

It might seem counterintuitive to add `hello.txt`, since it no longer exists.
What you should keep in mind is that `git add` adds *changes* to the staging
area, *not files,* and moving (or removing) a file is a change to that file.

:::{important}
Removing/deleting a file is a change to that file, just like creating, editing,
or moving the file.

If you want to delete a file called `FILE` from a repository, first delete the
file, then run `git add FILE` to add the change to the staging area, and
finally run `git commit` to make a commit.

Deleted files remain in the repository's history, so it's possible to restore
them later.
:::

Now check the status:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        renamed:    hello.txt -> README.md
```

After adding the changes to both files, Git correctly recognizes that the file
was moved/renamed. Go ahead and commit the change with the commit message
`Move hello.txt to README.md.`:

```none
git commit
```

```none
[main 4f57023] Move hello.txt to README.md.
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename hello.txt => README.md (100%)
```

If you check the status now, you'll see that the working tree is once again
clean.

:::{tip}
You can also make commits without opening a text editor. Use this command:

```none
git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

Replace `COMMIT_MESSAGE` with your commit message. You can't provide a detailed
description when you commit this way, so it's only appropriate for small,
simple commits.
:::


(sec-exploring-history)=
## Exploring History

<!-- TODO: incorporate this?
Git can keep track of different versions of any kind of file, but text files
(such as Markdown files) and code (such as R and Python scripts) are where it
excels. For these files, Git can provide rich feedback about differences
between versions.
-->

<!--
FIXME: better to introduce diff at the same time as add (and possibly split
adding and committing into two different sections).
-->

Now that you've made some commits, let's take a look at the repository's
history. To view the log of commits to a repository, enter the command:

```none
git log
```

```none
commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0 (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_EMAIL <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add a friendly greeting.

```

For each commit, the log lists the hash, name and email of the author,
timestamp, and commit message.

:::{note}
When a repository has a long history, `git log` will display the commits in a
scrolling window. You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll, and type
`q` (for quit) to return to the terminal.
:::

Let's make one more commit: we'll add a title to the `README.md` file. Open the
file with a text editor and add a title, so that it looks like this:

```md
# My README

Hi, I'm Nick, and this is my repository!
```

When you're finished, save the file. As usual, Git notices that something in
the repository has changed:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You can view the difference, or **diff** between the working tree and the most
recent commit with `git diff`:

```none
git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index cd08755..4e3eb18 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
+# My README
+
 Hello world!

```

The `git diff` command prints a diff for each file that's been changed. In each
diff, lines added since the last commit are prefixed with `+`, while lines
removed since the last commit are prefixed with `-`. For context, each diff
usually also includes a few lines that didn't change (no prefix). It's a good
idea to check `git diff` before adding files to the staging area, so that you
know what you're adding.

:::{tip}
If you've changed a lot of files, the output from `git diff` can be
overwhelming. You can use the command `git diff PATH` to view only the changes
to the file or directory at `PATH`.

You can also use `git diff --staged` to see the difference between files in the
staging area and the last commit.

There are many other ways to use `git diff`; check the documentation (`git diff
--help`) to learn more.
:::

Add and commit the changes. After you finish, you should have a third commit in
the repository history (`git log`) that looks something like this:

```none
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

```


## Restoring Old Versions of Files

<!--
FIXME: this example would be better if we went back several commits, and if
there were multiple files in the repo (to show that only the restored file
changes).
-->

Suppose you decide you don't like the title you added to `README.md` in
{numref}`sec-exploring-history`. If you want to change the title to something
different, the best approach is to edit the file and make a new commit. On the
other hand, if you want to restore an older version of the file, manual editing
is tedious and error-prone.

Instead, use the `git restore --source` command to restore a file to how it was
in a particular commit.

To demonstrate this, let's restore `README.md` to how it was in the commit
before we added a title. First check `git log` to get the commit's hash:

```none
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add a friendly greeting.

```

In this example, the hash begins `4f5702`, but it will be different for your
commit. As you can see from `git log`, the full hash for each commit is quite
long. For most Git commands that require a hash, you can just use the first few
digits. Git will let you know if it needs more digits to disambiguate which
commit you mean.

To restore `README.md` to how it was in commit `4f5702`, run:

```none
git restore --source 4f5702 README.md
```

Make sure to replace `4f5702` with the actual hash for your commit.

:::{danger}
Be careful with `git restore`: when you restore a file, any *uncommitted*
changes you've made to the file will be erased, and there's no undo.

If you just want to see what a file looked like in a previous commit, use `git
show HASH:FILE` instead, where `HASH` is the commit's hash and `FILE` is the
path to the file.
:::

After running the command, take a look at `README.md` with your text editor.
You should see that it no longer has the title. And if you look at the status
of the repository, you'll see that Git noticed the change:

```none
git status
```

```none
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

As with any other change, you can add and commit this change if you want to
save it in the repository's history.

:::{admonition} Tip: Undoing Commits
:class: tip, dropdown
If you want to undo an entire commit, use `git revert` rather than `git
restore`. Specifically, run:

```none
git revert HASH
```

Replace `HASH` with the hash of the commit you want to revert.

Git reverts a commit by creating a new commit, called a **revert commit**, with
changes exactly the opposite of the original: lines that were added get removed
and lines that were removed get added. Because of this, Git will prompt you for
a commit message when you run `git revert`; it's fine to use the default
message.
