Case-by-case Practices
======================

:::{attention}
This chapter is still a work-in-progress. Check back when you've got some
experience with research computing and are ready to learn more.
:::

This chapter covers case-by-case practices for reproducibility. Many of these
practices require substantial effort to adopt or require specific technical
knowledge. They can be important and even essential for certain kinds of
projects, but we feel they aren't broadly applicable in the ways that primary
and secondary practices are. DataLab occasionally adopts these practices. Read
this chapter when you feel like you've mastered the practices in the previous
chapters and want to learn even more.
